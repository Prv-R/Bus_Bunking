#AI-Driven Bus Bunching Mitigation System
This system tackles bus bunching (clustering of buses on the same route) by dynamically optimizing stop-skipping decisions based on real-time passenger load and proximity of trailing buses. It balances passenger demand, service efficiency, and rider experience while reducing fuel waste and emissions caused by idling or redundant stops.
